You can also use any existing OpenShift 4.2 to install the Cloud Pak into.\n- **Install Cloud Pak for Applications**  - The Cloud Pak is installed into the cluster and provides Transformation Advisor and Kabanero.  The installation provides IBM runtimes for Liberty, Microprofile, and Spring, as well as several open source projects which include Appsody, Tekton, and Knative.\n- **Install developer tools** - A developer is provided tools for an IDE and key CLIs to access the cluster.
