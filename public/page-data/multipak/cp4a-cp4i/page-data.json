Install cloud Pak for Application: [step-by-step](../application/introduction)\n2. Before Installing Cloud Pak for Integration\n    1. Possible Helm related issue:\n        1. Helm is already used by Cloud Pak for Application. \n        2. When Cloud Pak for Integration is trying to install on the same cluster and find same CRD for certificates, installation fails\n            1. Running an install after a failed partial install will lead to failure on the ICP creation in kube-system, due to missing secrets. \n    2. Solution:\n        1. There is a common component (a certificate) between CP for Integration and CP for Application that causes the CP for Integration installer to fail. \n        2. Run complete uninstall before reinstalling.\n            1. The uninstaller removes common component and allows the full install to run.\n            2. Uninstall may hang. To solve, check for pods stuck in terminating state and do a force delete:\n                1. ``` oc get pods --all-namespaces | grep Terminating ```\n                2. ``` oc delete pod <pod name> -n <project-name> --force --grace-period=0 ```\n3.
