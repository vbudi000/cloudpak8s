This document is specifically written for installations on OpenShift 4.2 with Multicloud Manager installed running on an x86 architecture. \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThis document does not describe how to install or configure the underlying OpenShift platform. So prior to installing make sure you have a working OpenShift cluster with Multicloud manager installed with the required capacity.\n\n- Check the requirements doc to make sure you have size your cluster appropriately and you have capacity\n- For offline installs make sure you have downloaded the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Passport Advantage Archive (PPA) file (see requirements) and copied it to the installation server\n- For online installs make sure you have an entitlement key to access the IBM Entitled Docker Registry\n- The installation is performed from the Command line (CLI) so you will need the reqiured CLI tools to interface with the cluster. Instructions on setting up the required CLI tools here: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFC4F_1.2.0/cli/cli_guide_mcm.html\n- Offline installation will require the docker client install on the installation server\n\n* [Install MCM](/content/mcm/cp4mcm_mcm_install/)\n\n## Online Installation\n\n## Offline Installation\n**1.
