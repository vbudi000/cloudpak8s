Note - you do not need to install this chart unless you are using datapower as a standalone capability.  When you install API Connect, it installs its own version of this chart as part of the APIC Cluster.\n\n### Prepare Installation\n\n1. **Change project to eventstreams**\n   ```\n   oc project datapower\n   ```\n\n### Begin Installation  \n1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside the **DataPower** tile.  \n\n1. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for installing. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.     \n2. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that were covered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).\n3. Click **Configure**\n4. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **datapower**\n5. Enter Target Namespace - **datapower**\n6. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.\n7. Check the license agreement. \n8. Under Parameters click **All Parameters** to expand. \n   1. Ingress - icp-proxy address defined during icp / common-services installation - icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;  \n   2. Image Pull Secret - Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled registry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your datapower namespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for your environment.\n9.  Scroll down to External access settings - enter the proxy address - **icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;.**\n10. Note:  If you want to enable access to the WebUI and XML/Rest Interfaces for your datapower instance, you will need to change those manually.  Otherwise, they will default to disabled.\n10. Scroll to the bottom. Click **Install**.\n\n### Validate Installation  \n1. check pods using the command line\n   ```\n   oc get pods -n datapower\n   NAME                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   dp-1-ibm-datapower-icp4i-fb888677-mvd9q   1/1       Running   0          3m\n   ```\n \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e9896d71644313c5ae6f6b1d6c458ef0","counter":178,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"deploy-secure-gateway","weight":600},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: deploy-secure-gateway\nweight: 600\n---\n\n- [Introduction](#introduction)\n- [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation)\n- [Begin Installation](#begin-installation)\n- [Validate Installation](#validate-installation)\n\n### Introduction\nThis page contains guidance on how to configure the Datapower Gateway release for both on-prem and ROKS.
