As of February 2020, this can be found as `IBM Cloud Pak For Integration 2019.4.1 On Openshift For Linux English (CC4R5EN )` in Passport Advantage.\n2. `ibm-cloud-private-rhos-3.2.1.tar.gz` The latest ICP package. This can also be download from Passport Advantage. Please note that `ibm-cp-int-2019.4.1-offline.tar.gz` comes packaged with `ibm-cloud-private-rhos-3.2.0.1906.tar.gz`. That means that if you want to install with **3.2.1 or above** as opposed to the **current default 1906** you must replace the ICP package.\n\n## CLI configuration\n\nYou must install all the correct Command Line Interfaces. Those are:\n\n1. IBM Cloud CLI, which can be installed using:\n\n    ``` md\n    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash\n    ```\n\n2. OpenShift CLI, which can be installed following the instruction [here on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli).\n3.
