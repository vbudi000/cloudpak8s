## Prerequisites

Before beginning these steps you should have:
1. A github account (or Github Enterprise)
1. A Dockerhub account (needed to install docker)
1. A Red Hat entitled customer account (to install oc)
1. An IDE (Eclipse or VS Code to use with Codewind)
1. A login for your Openshift Container cluster


## Installing Client tools from web pages on the cluster

A landing page is created during the install of Cloud Pak for Applications.
The landing page is available in the top menu bar and is named Cloud Pak Console.
The landing page is also found in the Administrator Console under Networking::Routes and is named icpa-landing in the kabanero namespace.
The Cloud Pak Console pages provide the most current installation information about the client tools.
This document will also provide links to these tools on the web.

When the OpenShift cluster is created, a reference page is generated for the OpenShift command line tools. There are several useful links on this page. Get this URL from your administrator.

%}

**Note:** You will need to authenticate (login) to your cluster.

The Cloud Pak Console provides additional information on installing additional development tools.  In the Console page, select the Setup dev tools button and follow instructions in the pop-up.
