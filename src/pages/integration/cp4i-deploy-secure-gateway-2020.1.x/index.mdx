### **Introduction**
This page contains guidance on how to configure the Datapower Gateway
release for both on-prem and IBM Cloud.  Note - you do not need to install this
chart unless you are using DataPower as a standalone capability.
When you install API Connect, it installs its own version of this chart
as part of the APIC Cluster.

### **Prepare Installation**

1. **Change project to eventstreams**
   ```
   oc project datapower
   ```

### **Begin Installation**
1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside the
**DataPower** tile.
2. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for
installing. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.
3. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that were
covered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).
4. Click **Configure**
5. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **datapower**
6. Enter Target Namespace - **datapower**
7. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.
8. Check the license agreement.
9. Under Parameters click **All Parameters** to expand.
   1. Ingress - icp-proxy address defined during icp / common-services
   installation - icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;
   2. Image Pull Secret - Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled
   registry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your
   datapower namespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for
   your environment.
10.  Scroll down to External access settings - enter the proxy
address - **icp-proxy.&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;.**
11. Note:  If you want to enable access to the WebUI and XML/Rest
Interfaces for your datapower instance, you will need to change those
manually.  Otherwise, they will default to disabled.
12. Scroll to the bottom. Click **Install**.

### **Validate Installation**
1. check pods using the command line
   ```
   oc get pods -n datapower
   NAME                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   dp-1-ibm-datapower-icp4i-fb888677-mvd9q   1/1       Running   0          3m
   ```

### **Access Web Interface**
1. Access the web interface (if enabled) by port-forwarding
   the port defined in the deployment (default 9090).

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward pod/dp-pod-name 9090:9090
   ```

   Access the web UI with local port
   * https://localhost:9090

   Login using default credentials
   * username: `admin`
   * password: `admin`

   If other features such as SSH (default 9022) or REST management interface (default 5554) are enabled,
   they can similarly be accessed via `localhost` by port-forwarding their respectively defined ports.
