## Solution Overview

IBM® Cloud Pak for Security provides a platform to quickly integrate your existing security tools to generate deeper insights into threats across hybrid, multicloud environments.

The IBM Cloud Pak for Security platform uses an infrastructure-independent common operating environment that can be installed and run anywhere. It comprises containerized software pre-integrated with Red Hat OpenShift enterprise application platform, which is trusted and certified by thousands of organizations around the world.

IBM Cloud Pak for Security can connect disparate data sources—to uncover hidden threats and make better risk-based decisions—while leaving the data where it resides. By using open standards and IBM innovations, IBM Cloud Pak for Security can securely access IBM and third-party tools to search for threat indicators across any cloud or on-premises location. Connect your workflows with a unified interface so you can respond faster to security incidents. Use IBM Cloud Pak for Security to orchestrate and automate your security response so that you can better prioritize your team's time.
