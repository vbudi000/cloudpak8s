IBM Cloud™ Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions
that give clients an open, fast and secure way to move core business
applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud Pak™ runs on Red Hat® OpenShift®
on IBM Cloud, other public clouds, or on-premises. IBM Cloud Paks include
containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development
and management.

The IBM Cloud Pak Playbook covers the following IBM Cloud Paks, running
on Red Hat OpenShift 4.2 or later:

Cloud Pak documentation should always be used as your first source of knowledge.
