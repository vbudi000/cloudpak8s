### Demos
There are several examples of how to run existing applications with the Cloud Pak for Applications.   Most will guide through the process of analyzing an existing WebSphere application, migrating to a Liberty container and deploying on the OpenShift and Cloud Pak.   Listed below are great starting points to showcase this approach:
