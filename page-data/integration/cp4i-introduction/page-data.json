Access all of the \nintegration capabilities that your team needs to balance \ntraditional and modern styles of integration. Enact the \nappropriate governance to provide the right level of access \nto each team member. Use any of the the capabilities \nindependently delivered via a modern DevOps process and \ntooling or together, through a single interface with a \nsingle login and dashboard.\n\n![Under the Hood](hood.jpeg)\n\nThe Cloud Pak delivers several core integration capabilities.\n\n- [API Lifecycle Management](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/api-lifecycle-management) (API Connect) allows you to expose, manage, share and monetize APIs across clouds\n- [Application and Data Integration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/application-and-data-integration) (App Connect) allows you to connect applications, data, legacy systems and modern technologies across on-premises, hybrid and multicloud environments\n- [Enterprise Messaging](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/enterprise-messaging) (MQ) connects business applications through a security-rich, robust and scalable messaging hub\n- [Event Streaming](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/event-streaming) (Event Streams) built on open-source Apache Kafka it promotes Event Driven Architectures (EDA) that allows you to analyze data associated with an event and respond to it in real time\n- [High-Speed Data Transfer](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/high-speed-data-transfer) (Aspera) enables you to overcome the challenges of legacy file transfer tools and physical shipping methods to move large amounts of data across global distances at maximum speed\n- [Secure Gateway](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration/secure-gateway) (DataPower) connects cloud and on-premises resources without the need for complex security configurations\n\nIn addition the Cloud Pak for Integration provides further \ncapabilities to help manage your integrations.\n\n- Operations Dashboard\n- Asset Repository\n\nThe installation steps for each of these capabilities are \nprovided below in the pages of this section.
