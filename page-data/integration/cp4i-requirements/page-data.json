Your cluster will likely host other Cloud Pak workload or be shared with other non-Cloud Pak workload.  Of course, licensing for Cloud Paks only covers the exact equivalent licenses for the underlying OCP.  You can find discussion from this section in the [Requirements Knowledge Center article](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_20.1/install/sysreqs.html) and for the Cloud Pak for Integration (choose the correct version).\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Integration Capability | CPU | Memory | Disk space |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Platform Navigator**:  A component product that provides easy access to deployed capabilities and their UIs.

The values given here are for default settings for a default flow example.  You should adjust the resource requirements for your flow after observing its behavior under usage.  To plan capacity for modernizing a large set of workload, assume that the modernize and traditional workload would use roughly the same amount of compute and memory.  App Connect workload does use a considerable amount of container storage.  For specific requirements regarding this capability, see the [IBM App Connect system requirements](https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=9305DA803ED511E7BE8E09C6CE305F89&osPlatforms=Linux%7CWindows&duComponentIds=D002%7CS001&optionalCapIds=341%7C7%7C47%7C9%7C1%7C131%7C39%7C8%7C184%7C27%7C186%7C15%7C26) | 1 core | 4 Gb | 2.3 Gb |\n| **High Speed File Transfer**: This capability is provided by deploying IBM Aspera.

Your persistent storage provider will depend largely on the cloud environment you are deploying to.  Each **public cloud** provider has their own storage services that can (and should) be used for your workload's persistent storage.  These providers will easily match to the requirements in the chart below.  Take time to understand fully each column.\n\nThere currently are more decisions to make when the solution is deployed into **private (on-premise) infrastructure**.  OpenShift now has the industry leading solution for providing container storage called Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (OCS).  See [this document](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.html) for a detailed explanation.  This solution is based upon Rook / Ceph and runs via operator.  It can be used without license in your lower environments without support.  At the time of this article being written OCS licensing for support etc. **is not included with Cloud Pak licenses** and must be purchased separately.  IBM Storage also has a hardware / software available for purchase to provide first-class persistent storage to your private cloud stateful containers.  Outside of these solutions using your enterprise NFS provides a decent option for providing **File** storage and Rook / Ceph provide adequate support for most **Block Storage** requirements.  For production workloads please consider the resilience of the persistent storage provider you chose.  In the near future OCS will be the preferred solution for production workload that require resilient on-premise storage.\n\nWith this guidance in mind, use the following table to help make your persistent storage decisions and create the required [storage classes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html) prior to deployment.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Integration Capability | Storage Type | Access Mode | Performance |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Common Services**:  Alert Manager | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommended 20 GB |\n| **Common Services**:  Elk Data Logging | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommended 30 GB |\n| **Common Services**:  Prometheus (Monitoring) | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommended 20 GB |\n| **Common Services**:  MongoDB (Default 3 instances) | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommended 20 GB (each instance) |\n| **Platform Navigator**: Not persistent storage required | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| **API Lifecycle and Management** | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommend 10 IOPS/GB |\n| **Queue Manager** | File | RWX | [Affected by other limits applied to the file system](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/testing-statement-ibm-mq-multi-instance-queue-manager-file-systems) |\n| **Event Messaging**: See the [IBM Event Streams storage documentation](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fibm.github.io%2Fevent-streams%2Finstalling%2Fprerequisites%2F%23file-systems-for-storage) There are three core components with their own requirements.

For environments that require resilience, the below is the best practice recommendation for hosting Cloud Pak for Integration on OCP 4.2 or 4.3.  You can configure smaller environments, but this is the getting-started suggestion.  Also, this cluster has a large enough control plane to grow in order to support a larger number of compute nodes for hosting additional workload.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Node | Nodes | vCPU | RAM | Storage |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Control Plane Nodes (Masters)** | 3 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 300 GB |\n| **Compute Nodes (Workers)** | 5 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 200 GB |\n| **Compute & Storage Nodes**: For use on primarily on-premise cluster to host OCS or Rook / Ceph storage.  These can run both storage and general workload. | 3 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 200 GB & 500 GB 2nd Disk|\n| **Install Node**: **This component is no longer used for v2020.2 and newer.** For offline installations of the Cloud Pak. See your specific OCP version and deployment mode for specifics.  Note that the offline Pak installation for Integration requires this larger disk. | 1 | 4 vCPU | 16 GB | 200 GB |\n| **Load Balancer(s)**:  If you do not have enterprise load balancing available you can optionally install HA Proxy load balancers for managing internal and external load balancing.  Consider the resiliency you require.  You can accomplish this using a single load balancer, but your architecture may require further diligence. | 1 or 2 | 4 vCPU | 8 GB | 100 GB |\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5977d15c26bd3e0fc4ddad3b79412bb9","counter":527,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Requirements","description":"Requirements and planning for the deploy of the Cloud Pak for Integration","keywords":"ibm, install, integration, cp4i, requirements, sizing, planning"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Requirements\ndescription: Requirements and planning for the deploy of the Cloud Pak for Integration\nkeywords: 'ibm, install, integration, cp4i, requirements, sizing, planning'\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Files to download</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>CLI configuration</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Workload Requirements</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>OCP Cluster Configuration Best-Practices</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Files to download\n\nYou will need one of the following downloads to perform the Cloud Pak installation\n\n- **CC644EN** - IBM Cloud Pak For Integration 2020.1.1 On Openshift For Linux English\n- **CC645EN** - IBM Cloud Pak For Integration 2020.1.1 On Openshift For Linux English Online Installer\n- IBM Cloud Pak for Integration 2020.2.x there is nothing required to download.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nFor offline / airgap installations please follow the instructions in the [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGT7J_20.2/install/mirroring_operators.html).

You can configure smaller environments, but this is the getting-started suggestion.  Also, this cluster has a large enough control plane to grow in order to support a larger number of compute nodes for hosting additional workload.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Node | Nodes | vCPU | RAM | Storage |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Control Plane Nodes (Masters)** | 3 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 300 GB |\n| **Compute Nodes (Workers)** | 5 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 200 GB |\n| **Compute & Storage Nodes**: For use on primarily on-premise cluster to host OCS or Rook / Ceph storage.  These can run both storage and general workload. | 3 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 200 GB & 500 GB 2nd Disk|\n| **Install Node**: **This component is no longer used for v2020.2 and newer.** For offline installations of the Cloud Pak. See your specific OCP version and deployment mode for specifics.  Note that the offline Pak installation for Integration requires this larger disk. | 1 | 4 vCPU | 16 GB | 200 GB |\n| **Load Balancer(s)**:  If you do not have enterprise load balancing available you can optionally install HA Proxy load balancers for managing internal and external load balancing.  Consider the resiliency you require.  You can accomplish this using a single load balancer, but your architecture may require further diligence. | 1 or 2 | 4 vCPU | 8 GB | 100 GB |\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/travis/build/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak8s/src/pages/integration/cp4i-requirements/index.mdx"}}}}
