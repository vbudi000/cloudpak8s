Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside\nthe **Tracing** tile.\n![](/assets/img/integration/deploy-tracing/2.tracing_nav.png)\n1. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for\ninstalling. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.\n  2. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that\n  were covered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).\n3. Click **Configure**\n4. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **tracing**\n5. Enter Target Namespace - **tracing**\n6. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.\n7. Check the license agreement.\n8. Under Parameters -> Quick start\n   1. Integration Platform Navigator Hostname -> This is the hostname of\n   your platform navigator.  Copy and paste without the https://\n   2. Global: Images Registry Secret -> This is your pull secret you\n   created in the previous set of instructions.  For IBM Cloud\n   installations, this will be created automatically.\n   3. Ingress: Hostname -> This is the hostname of your proxy node for\n   your install.\n   4. Configuration DB: Storage Class Name -> Storage Class for your block\n   storage (e.g. ceph, ibmc-block-bronze).  Tracing requires Block\n   (not file) storage.\n   5. Operations Dashboard Store: Storage Class Name -> Storage Class\n   for your block storage (e.g. ceph, ibmc-block-bronze). Tracing requires\n   Block (not file) storage.\n9.  Click `Install`\n10. If you are using entitled registry, the entire install process could\ntake up to 25-30 minutes to run depending on how long it takes to pull\nthe images down.\n\n\n### **Validate installation**\n\n1. View all pods running using `oc get pods`.  Output should resemble below\n![](/assets/img/integration/deploy-tracing/3.tracing-pods.png)\n\n### **Configure Tracing for the CP4I capabilities**\n\nAt the time of writing, the CP4I tracing capability includes the ability to trace MQ, App Connect Enterprise and API Connect.  MQ and API Connect only need to be configured once upon install of that capability.  For App Connect, you will enable tracing for each individual .bar file you deploy.  Note that if you deploy .bar files into the same namespace, you will only need to enable tracing for that namespace the first time you deploy to it.  To learn how to enable tracing for each capability see the documentation\n\n-  [App Connect](../deploy-app-int-2020.1.x)\n-  [API Connect](../deploy-api-mgmt-2020.1.x)\n-  [MQ](../deploy-mq-2020.1.x)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"35234179a7a57d6472884d77ef68933c","counter":473,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tracing","description":"Basic guide for deploying the Tracing","keywords":"ibm, install, integration, tracing, jaeger"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tracing\ndescription: Basic guide for deploying the Tracing\nkeywords: 'ibm, install, integration, tracing, jaeger'\n---\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nVersion 2020.2 is out for Cloud Pak for Ingegration.
