During the limited time duration of the residency, the group \nwas able to test two combinations, as follows:\n\n1. [Installing Cloud Pak for Integration first Cloud Pak for\nApplications second](../cp4i-cp4a/)\n2. [Installing Cloud Pak for Applications first Cloud Pak for\nIntegration second](../cp4a-cp4i/)\n\nEach chapter in this section links to the steps to install each of the \nrespective Cloud Paks in the test. Generally, there is no change to the\nstandard Cloud Pak installation instructions for these multiple Cloud Pak\nscenarios.\n\nHowever, there are some configuration steps recommended to avoid potential \nconflicts where both Cloud Paks include the same component. \nEach chapter describes those special steps to take, based on the group's\nexperience, to avoid problems. It is important to note that these\ndescriptions reflect the state of the Cloud Paks in January 2020.
