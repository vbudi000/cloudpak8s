Before you do that installation, read the following\nparagraphs to understand that your first installation attempt will\nfail. The following paragraphs describe the problem and the solution\nfor you to complete your installation of Cloud Pak for Integration\nsuccessfully.\n\n#### **Conflict with Installed Helm Component Issue:** \n\nThe `Helm` component is installed and used by Cloud Pak for Application. \nThe installation of Cloud Pak for Integration also includes the `Helm`\ncomponent. At the time of writing, there was no built-in function in the \ninstaller to deal with an already existing `Helm`.\n\nWhen the Cloud Pak for Integration is trying to install `Helm` on the same\ncluster, and finds an existing Custom Resource Definition (CRD) with  \na certificate for `Helm`, the installation fails. Cloud Pak for Applications\nand Cloud Pak for Integration share the same certificate, and the \nCloud Pak for Integration installer cannot tolerate the condition where\nthe certificate already exists.\n\nTrying to complete an installation after a failed partial install will \nresult in failure of the IBM Cloud Pak (ICP) common services creation in\nin the `kube-system` namespace, due to missing secrets.\n\n#### **Solution:**\n\nThe solution is to do a full uninstall of Cloud Pak for Integration after\nafter your initial installation fails, and then to reinstall it. \nThe uninstaller removes the common component and allows the reinstall to \nrun without encountering the conflict.\n\nIt is possible that the uninstall might hang. You can check for and \nclear that condition by checking for pods in a terminating state and \ndoing a force delete on them. Use the following command to see if you\nhave pods stuck in a terminating state.\n\n```\noc get pods --all-namespaces | grep Terminating\n```\n\nIf you do find pods in that condition, use the following command on each\nsuch pod to do a force deletion.\n\n```\noc delete pod <pod name> -n <project-name> --force --grace-period=0 \n```\n\n### 3. **Installing Cloud Pak for Integration**\n\nThe Cloud Pak for Integration can be installed following the instructions\nin the \n[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/install.html) \nor in the [Cloud Pak for Integration](/integration/introduction)\nsection of this Playbook.\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"cc6d898f8b8c77e89f67e8f1e3dadfbd","counter":484,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scenario 2","weight":200},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Scenario 2\nweight: 200\n---\n## **Installing Cloud Pak for Applications Then Cloud Pak for Integration**\n\nThis section describes the scenario of installing Cloud Pak \nfor Applications first, followed by Cloud Pak for Integration. \n\nFrom the experience of the residency group, if you are wanting to \ninstall these two Cloud Paks in this order in the same cluster, it is important\nto follow the instructions below to resolve conflicts and make things\ngo smoothly\n\nThe first step is to consider the prerequisites for the Cloud Paks you\nwant to install and to make sure your cluster has the required resources.\n\n### **Cloud Pak for Applications Prerequisites**\n* Refer to the Knowledge Center \n[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.x/install-prerequisites.html) \n(Cloud Pak for Applications 4.0.x) \nfor details on what is required before starting an installation.\n* Also consider the prerequisites for installing the Cloud Pak for Applications\ndeveloper tools.
