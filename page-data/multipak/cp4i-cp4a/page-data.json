If the solution steps below are not done, \n   the `CouchDB` installation will fail. The \n   Cloud Pak for Applications `Transformation Advisor (TA)` component \n   requires ReadWriteMany (RWX) storage. This means you need \n   at least one RWX storage volume available. The solution below \n   describes configuring NFS for RWX storage, which was the option\n   used in January 2020.\n\n   There should be an option to choose a storage class in \n   the `config.yaml` file. However,  this option did not exist at the \n   time of writing.\n\n#### **Solution:**\n\n1. Create an NFS export on an NFS server.\n2. Define a Read Write Many (RWX) Persistent Volume (PV) \non the cluster to point to your NFS export.\n3. Change the storage class name in the Transformation\nAdvisor operator definition, so that it uses the NFS storage.\n\n    ``` \n    oc edit crd transadvs.charts.ta.cloud.ibm.com \n    ```\n\nKeep in mind that this configuration will be overwritten by installing \na later release. The only alternative is to change the default storage class.\n\n**Note:** The Cloud Pak for Applications installer will report \nthat the installation completed \neven if the `Transformation Advisor (TA)` fails.\n\n### 3. **Installing Cloud Pak for Applications**\n\nThe Cloud Pak for Applications can be installed following the instructions\nin the \n[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.0.x/install-icpa.html) \nor in the [Cloud Pak for Applications](/apps/cp4a_overview)\nsection of this Playbook.\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1b7ced174d2a83c593807a4d77698754","counter":485,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scenario 1","weight":200},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Scenario 1\nweight: 200\n---\n## **Installing Cloud Pak for Integration Then Cloud Pak for Applications**\n\nThis section describes the scenario of installing Cloud Pak \nfor Integration first, followed by Cloud Pak for Applications. \n\nFrom the experience of the residency group, if you are wanting to \ninstall these two Cloud Paks in the same cluster, installing them in\nthis order is recommended.\n\nThe first step is to consider the prerequisites for the Cloud Paks you\nwant to install and to make sure your cluster has the required resources.\n\n### **Cloud Pak for Integration Prerequisites**\n* Refer to the Knowledge Center \n[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/sysreqs.html) \n(Cloud Pak for Integration 2019.4)\nfor details on what is required before starting an installation.\n\n### **Cloud Pak for Applications Prerequisites**\n* Refer to the Knowledge Center \n[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.x/install-prerequisites.html) \n(Cloud Pak for Applications 4.0.x) \nfor details on what is required before starting an installation.\n* Also consider the prerequisites for installing the Cloud Pak for Applications\ndeveloper tools.
