The easiest and most embraced logging method for kubernetes platform components and containerized applications is to write to the standard output and standard error streams. These logs can be viewed on a Pod level using `oc logs` CLI or via OpenShift web console (Workload -> Pod -> Pod Details -> Logs).\n\nHowever, the native functionality provided by a container engine or runtime is usually not enough for a complete logging solution. For example, if a container crashes, a pod is evicted, or a node dies, usually you will still want to access your application’s logs. As such, logs should have a separate storage location, and lifecycle that is independent of nodes, pods, or containers. This concept is called cluster-level-logging. Cluster-level logging requires a separate backend to store, analyze, and query logs. OpenShift provides a logging solution based on EFK stack ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/architecture) (or Rsyslog), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html)). The collector, Fluentd, is deployed to each node in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. It collects all node and container logs and writes them to Elasticsearch (ES). Kibana is the centralized web UI where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.\n\n\n## Day 1 Platform\n\nImplementation of the Logging solution based on EFK stack provided by OpenShift should be planned during design (Day 0) phase. Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node requires its own storage volume.\n\nElasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and limits with OpenShift 4.3. The initial set of OpenShift Container Platform nodes might not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. In that case you may need to add additional nodes to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster to run with the recommended or higher memory. Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.\n\nThe OpenShift logging solution based on the EFK stack is deployed separately to OpenShift cluster installation. Follow the instructions specified in OpenShift documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html in order to deploy full logging solution.\nCheck also the [deployment steps for logging solution for OpenShift on AWS](./EFK_AWS/).\n\nDeployment steps include installation of two Operators: Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator as well as creating of Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to schedule cluster logging pods and other resources necessary to support cluster logging. The Operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging. \n![](./images/2020-02-11-17-05-10.png)\n\n**Day 1 Platform tasks for Logging:**\n  \n  - Size system resources for logging components\n  - Deploy Elasticsearch and Cluster Logging Operators   \n\n\n## Day 2 Platform\n\nThe default settings of Cluster Logging CR are tuned for small to medium sized OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

If structured correctly, logs can contain a wealth of information about a specific event. Logs can tell us not only when the event took place, but also provide us with details as to the root cause. Therefore, it is important that the log entries are readable to humans and machines. CSMO GSE provides a set of recommendations for a proper logging during application code development ([Build to Manage POV - chapter 4.2 \"Logging Format and Catalog](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/files/service-management-pov-csmo-build-to-manage-v1.1.pdf)).\nMake sure that all containerized application components log to STDOUT/STDERR in order to collect these logs automatically by Fluentd. \n\n**Day 1 Application tasks for logging:**\n\n- Good practices for logging during application code development    \n\n\n## Day 2 Application\n\nApplication logs are collected automatically by the OpenShift EFK stack and stored in the `project.<project_name>.<project_id>.<date>` index.

You can configure the Curator cron schedule using the Cluster Logging CR and further configuration options can be found in the Curator ConfigMap, `curator` in the `openshift-logging` project.\n\nThe following Curator settings can be configured via `Cluster Logging CR` definition:\n\n- [Configuring the Curator schedule](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-curator.html#cluster-logging-curator-schedule_cluster-logging-curator)\n- [Configuring Curator index deletion](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-curator.html#cluster-logging-curator-yaml_cluster-logging-curator)\n- [Configuring tollerations to control Curator pod placement](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-tolerations.html#cluster-logging-curator-tolerations_cluster-logging-tolerations)\n\n\n<a name=\"Configuring-log-collector-Fluentd\"></a>\n\n##  Configuring log collector (Fluentd) [ SRE ]\n\nOpenShift Container Platform uses Fluentd to collect platform and application logs from your cluster which OpenShift Container Platform enriches with Kubernetes Pod and Namespace metadata.\n\nYou can configure log rotation, log location, use an external log aggregator, and make other configurations for the log collector.\n\nThe following log colector settings can be configured via `Cluster Logging CR` definition:\n\n- [Configure Fluentd CPU and memory limits](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-limits_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Configuring the collected log location](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-location_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Throttling log collection](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-throttling_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Configuring log collection JSON parsing](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-json_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Configuring how the log collector normalizes logs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-undefined_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Configuring the logging collector using environment variables](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-collector.html#cluster-logging-collector-envvar_cluster-logging-collector)\n- [Configuring tollerations to control Fluentd pod placement](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-tolerations.html#cluster-logging-collector-tolerations_cluster-logging-tolerations)\n\n\n<a name=\"Forwarding-logs-to-external-logging-systems\"></a>\n\n## Forwarding logs to external logging systems [ SRE ]\nThe preferred logging management approach for your organization may be forwarding the logs to an external server with dedicated large capacity of storage. By sending log messages to a remote log server, it will help reduce disk space issues and also meet certain compliance requirements. OpenShift provides two ways to forward logs to external log server.  \n\n### Log Forwarding feature (Tech Preview, OpenShift 4.3 only)\n\nThe cluster logging `Log Forwarding` feature enables administrators to configure custom pipelines to send your container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type (application logs, OpenShift platform logs or audit logs) to remote destinations not managed by OpenShift Container Platform cluster logging, such as your existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, external log aggregation solutions, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. [How to enable and configure Log Forwarding on OpenShift 4.3](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-log-forwarding.html).\n\n\n### Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd Forward plug-ins\n\nAnother alternative method of forwarding logs to the external logging systems is to use Fluentd `out_forward` plug-in. This way we can configure Fluentd instances to forward logs to the external secured Fluentd instance which can forward logs to any system supported by Fluentd. [How to configure Fluentd out_forward plugin on OpenShift 4.3](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-external.html).\n\n\n<a name=\"Monitoring-of-Elasticsearch\"></a>\n\n##  Monitoring of Elasticsearch [ SRE ]\nElasticsearch has built-in Prometheus support and can expose Prometheus metrics showing current health and performance. The Cluster Logging Operator automatically configures OpenShift Prometheus to collect Elasticsearch metrics. OpenShift provides also predefined set of alerts for OpenShift Elasticsearch:\n\n**Alert** | **Description** | **Severity**\n----- | ----- | -----\nElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy  |  Cluster health status has been RED for at least 2m. Cluster does not accept writes, shards may be missing or master node hasn’t been elected yet.  |  critical\nElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy  |  Cluster health status has been YELLOW for at least 20m.

Everything a containerized application writes to stdout and stderr is handled and redirected by a container engine to physical logs located on worker nodes. For example, the Docker container engine redirects those two streams to a logging driver, which is configured in Kubernetes to write to a file in json format. When you run `kubectl logs`, the kubelet on the node handles the request and reads directly from the log file, returning the contents in the response.\n\n##  OpenShift\nOpenShift provides EFK stack pre-configured and managed by Cluster Logging Operator described in this document.

By sending log messages to a remote log server, it will help reduce disk space issues and also meet certain compliance requirements. OpenShift provides two ways to forward logs to external log server.  \n\n### Log Forwarding feature (Tech Preview, OpenShift 4.3 only)\n\nThe cluster logging `Log Forwarding` feature enables administrators to configure custom pipelines to send your container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type (application logs, OpenShift platform logs or audit logs) to remote destinations not managed by OpenShift Container Platform cluster logging, such as your existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, external log aggregation solutions, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. [How to enable and configure Log Forwarding on OpenShift 4.3](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-log-forwarding.html).\n\n\n### Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd Forward plug-ins\n\nAnother alternative method of forwarding logs to the external logging systems is to use Fluentd `out_forward` plug-in. This way we can configure Fluentd instances to forward logs to the external secured Fluentd instance which can forward logs to any system supported by Fluentd. [How to configure Fluentd out_forward plugin on OpenShift 4.3](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/config/cluster-logging-external.html).\n\n\n<a name=\"Monitoring-of-Elasticsearch\"></a>\n\n##  Monitoring of Elasticsearch [ SRE ]\nElasticsearch has built-in Prometheus support and can expose Prometheus metrics showing current health and performance. The Cluster Logging Operator automatically configures OpenShift Prometheus to collect Elasticsearch metrics. OpenShift provides also predefined set of alerts for OpenShift Elasticsearch:\n\n**Alert** | **Description** | **Severity**\n----- | ----- | -----\nElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy  |  Cluster health status has been RED for at least 2m. Cluster does not accept writes, shards may be missing or master node hasn’t been elected yet.  |  critical\nElasticsearchClusterNotHealthy  |  Cluster health status has been YELLOW for at least 20m.

Everything a containerized application writes to stdout and stderr is handled and redirected by a container engine to physical logs located on worker nodes. For example, the Docker container engine redirects those two streams to a logging driver, which is configured in Kubernetes to write to a file in json format. When you run `kubectl logs`, the kubelet on the node handles the request and reads directly from the log file, returning the contents in the response.\n\n##  OpenShift\nOpenShift provides EFK stack pre-configured and managed by Cluster Logging Operator described in this document. [Example deployment steps for logging solution for OpenShift on AWS](./EFK_AWS/).\n\n##  IBM Cloud\n\nYou can find which solutions are available for logging on IBM Cloud in [here](./LogDNA_IBM/).\n\n##  IBM Cloud Pak for MCM\nIBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management provides logging solution based on ELK (based on Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Filebeat). \nInstallation of ELK stack is optional and can be [enabled or disabled](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFC4F_1.2.0/install/disable_and_enable_services.html) during MCM Cloud Pak installation.\n\n[Humio](https://www.humio.com/faq) is a new logging solution that is (or will be) included with IBM Cloud Pak for MCM. \n- [Humio and MCM](https://www.humio.com/ibm-humio).\n \n\n## Others\n[Grafana Looki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.\n\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/travis/build/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudpak8s/src/pages/day2/Logging/index.mdx"}}}}
